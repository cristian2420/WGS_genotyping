## About it

The pipeline was developed for WGS genotyping for the DICE Tissue project (unpublished). It was implemented using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow manager based on GATK Best Practice recommendations and [GTEx](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz1776) Supplementary Material. Cluster configuration file (cluster.json) needs to be modified according to the cluster/cloud enviroment to work properly.
